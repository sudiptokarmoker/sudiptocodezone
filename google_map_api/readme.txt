This key works fine :

Test should look exactly like these 2 pages. Each page is seperate and both pages must have address suggestions for users. No cursors, everything automatic.

1st page is only for browsing general cities.

- When you search any location, map is supposed to go directly to that location. 

- Should have post button which takes user to page 2.

- Page 2 Should have ability to post red pins onto page 1 using address suggestions (all pins must remain on map). 

- Should have post button which takes user back to page 1. 

Please send me temporary website url to test functionality on my phone.
